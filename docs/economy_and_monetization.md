# Economy & Monetization Blueprint

## Currency Ecosystem
| Currency | Type | Sources | Sinks | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Coins | Soft | Harvesting, order board, co-op donations, events | Building upgrades, land expansions, crafting fees | Earned in every session; tuned to keep players upgrading steadily. |
| Gems | Premium | Starter packs, seasonal pass, special offers, ad rewards, achievements | Speed-ups, exclusive decor, event continues, booster packs | No direct conversion from gems to competitive advantage. |
| Reputation Points (RP) | Social | Co-op quests, research donations, leaderboard rewards | Co-op research, community buildings | Drives social participation. |
| Certificates | Progression | Seasonal events, limited-time contracts, milestone quests | Advanced expansions, machine crafting, late-game upgrades | Acts as long-term gate to ensure content longevity. |
| Energy | Session | Generated hourly, friend help, rewarded ads | Special missions, mini-games | Prevents burnout and structures play sessions. |

## Pricing Philosophy
- **Fair Value:** Pricing benchmarks align with genre standards (e.g., $4.99 starter bundle, $9.99 season pass).
- **No Paywalls:** Primary progression relies on skillful management, not spending.
- **Dynamic Offers:** System reacts to player behavior (returning player bundles, completionist packs, co-op booster discounts).
- **Transparent Odds:** Loot-box style mechanics avoided; if blind packs exist, publish probability tables.

## Order & Market Systems
- **Order Board:** Daily rotation of 9 orders with varying difficulty; refreshing costs gems or completes automatically every 6 hours.
- **Wholesale Market:** Players list crafted items for asynchronous trading. Market fees remove coins from economy to control inflation.
- **Shipping Contracts:** Time-limited batches requiring packing crates; success yields coins, certificates, and chance for rare parts.

## Production Balancing
- **Crop Tiers:**
  - Tier 1 (lettuce, wheat): 2–5 min timers, high demand in early orders.
  - Tier 2 (corn, carrots): 10–20 min timers, moderate value.
  - Tier 3 (strawberries, cotton): 45–90 min timers, feed mid-tier recipes.
  - Tier 4 (vanilla, cocoa): 3–6 hr timers, event gating.
- **Animal Care:** Happiness decays when unfed; high happiness grants bonus yields. Auto-feeder machine offsets micromanagement.
- **Processing Slots:** Buildings start with 1–2 slots; upgrades unlock more, encouraging investment.

## Monetization Features
1. **Seasonal Pass**
   - Free track includes core progression rewards.
   - Premium track ($9.99) adds exclusive decor, cosmetics, and bonus gems.
   - Pass XP earned via daily/weekly quests and event participation.
2. **Farm Club Subscription**
   - Monthly $4.99 subscription providing daily gem stipend, expanded order queue, and exclusive profile badge.
   - Cancel anytime; benefits pause at end of cycle.
3. **Event Bundles**
   - Themed bundles containing crafting boosts, decor, and energy refills.
   - Limited purchases to avoid pay-to-win scenarios.
4. **Rewarded Ads**
   - Optional; players watch short videos for small perks (speed-up ticket, extra order slot, temporary boost).
   - Daily limit prevents fatigue and preserves monetization balance.
5. **Personalized Offers**
   - Machine learning-driven segmentation adjusts pricing and contents based on player segment (early, engaged, dormant).

## Anti-Whale Safeguards
- Hard caps on purchasable speed-ups per day.
- Matchmaking in competitive events uses weighted brackets to prevent high spenders from dominating.
- VIP program focuses on cosmetics and quality-of-life rather than raw power.
