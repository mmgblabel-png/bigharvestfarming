## Tooling Requirements
- Live config dashboard to schedule events, adjust rewards, and monitor KPIs.
- Real-time analytics for participation, completion rates, and monetization impact.
- Automated QA checklist for event deployment (localization, asset references, reward tables).

## Post-Event Retrospective
1. Gather quantitative data (retention deltas, revenue uplift, completion rates).
2. Collect qualitative feedback via in-game surveys.
3. Document learnings in Confluence, adjust future event designs.
4. Update backlog with balance changes or feature requests derived from the event.
