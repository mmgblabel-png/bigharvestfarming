# Big Harvest Farming

A concept design and documentation set for a mobile free-to-play farming simulation inspired by the core gameplay loops of titles such as **Goodgame Big Farm**. The goal of this repository is to define the game pillars, gameplay systems, production chains, and supporting live-ops required to build a vibrant farming world where players can grow crops, raise animals, craft goods, trade with others, and collaborate in co-ops.

The documentation in this repository includes:

- A high-level game design overview covering progression, systems, and live events.
- A content catalog describing planned buildings, products, decorations, and cooperative technologies.
- Monetization, economy, and retention considerations for a sustainable freemium experience.
- Technical and art direction guidelines to help align engineering and creative teams.

Use these documents as a starting point for fleshing out production roadmaps, backlog items, and UI/UX prototypes.
